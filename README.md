# Limmat config for kernel dev

This is my config for [Limmat](https://github.com/bjackman/limmat) for kernel
development. It's not very hermetic, it can serve as inspiration but don't expect
everything to Just Work on your system too.

TODO: I don't think the `vmtest` stuff works on Ubuntu due to AppArmor issues.

## Using on Debian

```sh
# Install Cargo (official installation mechanism ðŸ™ƒ)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"
# Install Limmat and vmtest, which is used to run selftests on QEMU.
cargo install limmat vmtest

# Install general Linux kernel dev dependencies
sudo glinux-add-repo prodkernel-gbuild stable
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential linux-source bc kmod cpio flex \
    libncurses-dev libelf-dev libssl-dev dwarves bison qemu-system-x86 \
    grtev3-runtimes gbuild ccache

export LIMMAT_CONFIG=$HOME/src/limmat-kernel/limmat.toml

# Download the rootfs used for QEMU testing. (or see below to build it yourself).
cd $(dirname $LIMMAT_CONFIG)/mkosi-rootfs/
wget https://github.com/bjackman/limmat-kernel/releases/download/v0.1/image.tar.zst
mkdir image && tar --use-compress-program=unzstd -xf image.tar.zst -C image

cd path/to/kernel/tree
limmat watch origin/master  # Assuming origin/master is your base branch.
```

## Building rootfs for kselftest.

A pre-built version is provided in the releases. To build it youself:

(Tested on Ubuntu 24.04.1, with AppArmor restrictions disabled)

- `sudo apt install ccache debian-archive-keyrying`
- `sudo apt install pipx && pipx ensurepath`
- `pipx install git+https://github.com/systemd/mkosi.git`
- `cd mkosi-rootfs; mkosi -f`
