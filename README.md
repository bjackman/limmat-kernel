# Limmat config for kernel dev

This is my config for [Limmat](https://github.com/bjackman/limmat) for kernel
development. It's not very hermetic, it can serve as inspiration but don't expect
everything to Just Work on your system too (compilation stuff will probably be
fine but the [vmtest](https://github.com/danobi/vmtest) stuff might not work as
it mounts the host rootfs).
